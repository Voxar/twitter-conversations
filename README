What? 
New go at reading twitter in a more conversation like style

How?
Download twitter.rb
Usage: twitter.rb username password
  to follow conversations your friends are in
OR: twitter.rb status_id
  to follow specific conversation (from status_id and up)

Why? 
It's near impossible to follow conversations on twitter

What u need?
require 'rubygems' # the required requirement......
require 'open-uri' # built in? cant remember...
require 'JSON'     # sudo gem install json

Notes!
Uses twitters rest API which has a per-ip limit of 100 requests per hour (shared with other twitter apps on your computer!). 
To not use too many of your precious a directory called 'cache' will be created where the script is.
If there are many long conversations the number of requests can be high on the first run.
If you get exception with code 400 you have hit the limit.
